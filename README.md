# PSoC&trade; Edge MCU: Graphics LVGL Demo

This code example demonstrates displaying a 2D graphics demo on a 10.1 inch 1024*600 TFT LCD (WF101JTYAHMNB0) using the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL) on PSoC&trade; Edge MCU. The 2D graphics displays a music player application, which is listed as one of the standard demo on the LVGL page. The LCD is connected via the MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) and the code is designed to run in a FreeRTOS environment.

This code example has a three project structure - CM33 Secure, CM33 Non-Secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in XIP mode. Extended Boot launches the CM33 Secure project from a fixed location in the external flash , which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 Non-Secure application. Additionally, CM33 Non-Secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application. The CM55 application implements the logic for this code example.

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "**PSoC Edge Graphics LVGL Demo**" application with the desired name "MyLvglDemo" configured for the *KIT_PSOCE84_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSOCE84_EVK --app-id mtb-example-psoc-edge-gfx-lvgl-demo --user-app-name MyLvglDemo --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the **BSP manifest** | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the **CE manifest** | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Design and implementation

This project uses 10.1 inch [WF101JTYAHMNB0](https://www.winstar.com.tw/products/tft-lcd/ips-tft/ips-touch.html) TFT LCD. The TFT LCD houses a [EK79007AD3](https://www.crystalfontz.com/controllers/Fitipower/EK79007AD3/505/) display controller and uses the MIPI DSI interface.

The design of this application is kept straightforward to help the user get started with code examples on PSoC&trade; Edge MCU devices. All PSoC&trade; Edge E84 MCU applications have a dual-CPU three-project structure to develop code for the CM33 and CM55 cores. The CM33 core has two separate projects for the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) and Non-secure Processing Environment (NSPE). A project folder consists of various subfolders – each denoting a specific aspect of the project. The three project folders are as follows:

**Table 1. Application Projects**

Project | Description
--------|------------------------
proj_cm33_s | Project for CM33 Secure Processing Environment (SPE)
proj_cm33_ns | Project for CM33 Non-secure Processing Environment (NSPE)
proj_cm55 | CM55 Project

In this code example, at device reset, the secured boot process starts from the ROM boot in the Secured Enclave as the Root of Trust. From the Secured Enclave, the boot flow is passed on to the System CPU Subsystem where the secure CM33 application is first started. After all necessary secure configurations, the flow is passed on to the non-secure CM33 application. Resource initialization for this example is performed by this CM33 non-secure project. It configures the system clocks, pins, clock to peripheral connections, and other platform resources. It then enables the CM55 core using the Cy_SysEnableCM55() function and allows Idle task to put CM33 in DeepSleep mode.

The CM55 application drives the LCD and renders the image using PSoC&trade; Edge graphics subsystem. The graphics subsystem of PSoC&trade; Edge MCU houses an independent 2.5D graphics processing unit (GPU), a display controller (DC), and a MIPI DSI host controller with MIPI D-PHY physical layer interface.

**cm55_ns_gfx_task** initializes the Graphics subsystem and configures the GPU interrupt. After that it calls the `wf101jtyahmnb0_init()` function
to initialize the LCD panel. Once the panel is initialized, required amount of memory is allocated for VGLite draw/blit functions to be consumed by LVGL library.
The `lv_init()` function is used to initialize LVGL and set up the essential components required for LVGL to work correctly. The display and touch  drivers are initialized using `lv_port_disp_init()` and `lv_port_indev_init()` functions respectively. The LVGL demo music player is displayed on the 10.1 inch (WF101JTYAHMNB0) display by calling the LVGL demo widget API `lv_demo_music()`.
In order to switch to other available LVGL demos, user need to enable the `LV_USE_DEMO_<demo_name>` macro in `lv_conf.h` file and call the corresponding `lv_demo_<demo_name>()` API in place of `lv_demo_music()`.
